note:: The protocol used in this Template is http and the port is set to 5000 
when running on Kestrel or a random one on IISExpress. You can change that in the 
Properties\launchSettings.json file. However, 
all of the quickstart instructions will assume you use the default port on Kestrel as well as the http protocol, 
which is sufficient for local development.


**************************************************************
Front end tasks

create get edit lookup in base edit component and map it to api in backend
to solve the problem in editing mode when there is multiple dropdown and there are independent dropdown

create an observable to get the data of the role when edit an see if the changes will be reflected instead of storing role in storage and login and logut to reflect changes

use dynamic routing in front end 
let auth guard read the page name dynamic and check for permissions
